# Grading Guidelines
This document details the criteria we will use in grading your homework.

* If your homework passes all of the provided unit tests, you will very likely receive full credit on the assignment
* We do reserve the right to run your code on a different (more exhaustive) set of tests. We will not test anything that is not asked or specified in the question prompt.
* If you "hack" your code to pass the tests, you will be heavily penalized. This includes techniques such as hard-coding the output of a function to match the expected value in the test. We will be looking at your code and will be able to catch this type of cheating.
* If you modify the provided test suite you will be heavily penalized. 
* Extra credit points may be given for good coding practice, such as clean, well-commented code, extra unit tests, elegant solutions, etc. 
* Some points may be deducted for extremely poor coding hygiene (no comments, overly complex or convoluted solutions, poor use of spacing, etc.)
